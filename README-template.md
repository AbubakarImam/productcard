### What I learned
Learned the importance of choosing a screen mode you will be styling first before adding the css,
learn much about flexbox
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
